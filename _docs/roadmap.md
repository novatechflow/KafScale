- Produce path (v0-9) with S3-backed durability
- Fetch path (v11-13) with LRU caching and read-ahead
- Metadata API (v0-12) with topic/partition discovery
- ListOffsets (v0)

### Consumer groups

- FindCoordinator (v3)
- JoinGroup, SyncGroup, Heartbeat, LeaveGroup (v4)
- OffsetCommit (v3) and OffsetFetch (v5) with etcd persistence

## Explicitly not planned

Some features are intentionally out of scope for KafScale. These are architectural decisions, not missing features.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Transactions (EOS) | Requires coordination complexity incompatible with stateless brokers |
| Compacted topics | Requires stateful compaction process; use a database instead |
| Kafka replication protocols | LeaderAndIsr, UpdateMetadata, etc. not needed with S3 as source of truth |
| Embedded stream processing | Out of scope; use Flink, Wayang, Spark, or other external engines |
| Tiered storage | S3 is already the primary tier; no local disk to tier from |
| Sub-10ms latency | Fundamental S3 round-trip constraint; use Kafka or Redpanda |
| KRaft / ZooKeeper | etcd is the metadata store; no Kafka controller needed |

If your use case requires these features, KafScale may not be the right fit. See [Comparison](/comparison/) for alternatives.

## How to request features

1. Check [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/KafScale/platform/issues) for existing requests
2. Open a new issue with:
   - Your use case
   - Expected throughput and latency requirements
   - Operational constraints (cloud provider, compliance, etc.)
3. Join the discussion in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/KafScale/platform/discussions)

We prioritize features based on community demand and alignment with KafScale's core mission: simple, stateless, S3-native Kafka compatibility.
